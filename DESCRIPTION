Description: Contains K-means clustering algorithm and Logistic Regression Multiclass algorithms optimised in C++. Kmeans algorithm categorizes a matrix of covariates into a vector of cluster assignments based on minimum euclidean distance.L. R. Multicalss algorithm optimizes a vector of scalars to best fit an input training matrix with an input vector of classifications.
